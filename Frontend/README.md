## **Executive summary**

Our proposed app is a social media platform that allows users to connect with each other through music. Users can share their favorite songs, create playlists, and discover new music. The app also has a music player feature that allows users to listen to music offline. We believe that music is a powerful way to connect people. It can bring people together from all walks of life and create a sense of community. Our app aims to harness the power of music to bring people together and create a more social and connected world.

Our app is designed for anyone who loves music. This includes music lovers of all ages, genres, and backgrounds. The app is also a great way for musicians to connect with their fans and share their music with the world. There are a number of similar applications available, such as Spotify, Soundcloud, and Apple Music. However, our app aims to differentiate itself by focusing on the social aspect of music. Users can use our app to connect with other music lovers, share their favorite songs, and discover new music.
